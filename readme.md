This is a proof of concept for a video game mechanic idea I had back in college called Automatron.<br>
The Automatron mechanic uses a DFA to process binary representations of ASCII characters and applies rules based on specific patterns, like detecting whether the binary string contains the substring "10" or not and whether it ends with "1" or "0."<br>
It aims to gamify the concept of formal languages. Players could potentially learn to "craft" specific inputs that maximize damage. The binary conversion adds an extra layer of complexity/strategy since different characters will produce different binary patterns. The DFA ensures consistent, predictable behavior while still allowing for creative inputs. This system could create a unique gaming experience where:
<ul>
<li>Players learn and master pattern recognition</li>
<li>Strategy comes from both pattern knowledge and execution</li>
<li>Different playstyles emerge based on pattern preferences</li>
<li>Complexity scales naturally with player skill</li>
<li>Creates memorable "aha!" moments when players discover new patterns</li>
</ul>
