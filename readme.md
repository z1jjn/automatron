This is a proof of concept for a video game mechanic idea I had back in college called Automatron.<br>
The Automatron mechanic uses a DFA to process binary representations of ASCII characters and applies rules based on specific patterns, like detecting whether the binary string contains the substring "10" or not and whether it ends with "1" or "0."<br>
It aims to gamify the concept of formal languages.
